# Open Evernote from OmniFocus
This script can help you create or open a note of Evernote for the selected OmniFocus task.

- If the note of the OmniFocus task contains an Evernote link—usually locating in a single line, then this script will open it in Evernote.
- Otherwise, this script will create a new note of Evernote and open it in a new window of Evernote.
  - The title and the content of the new note are from the name and the note of the OmniFocus task, correspondingly.
  - The Evernote link will be appended at the end of the note of OmniFocus task.
  - The source URL of the new Evernote note will be assigned to the link of the OmniFocus task.
